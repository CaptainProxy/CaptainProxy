A cheat for version 1.2.2 of the My Little Pony Android/iOS game.

This cheat is intended for advanced users only, and has very particular hardware requirements. You will need some sort of Linux-based router or firewall between your phone and the internet. Most consumer-grade routers will work for this, so if you have a Linksys, Buffalo, Actiontek, or similar router, you should be on the right track.

If you don't have Python installed yet, go to https://www.python.org/ to download it.

Make sure that any firewall on your computer is set to allow python.exe through.

My patience for documentation is wearing thin, but private message me on reddit and I'll be happy to help.
